Programming
	I am a junior in computer science (computer systems).
	Last fall, I changed my major from electrical engineering to computer science.
	I did not know that I liked programming until I took CS 161 my sophomore year.
	The computer science courses that I have taken are CS 161, CS 162, CS 260, CS 344, and CS 361.
	I am currently enrolled in CS 225 and CS 362.
	My favorite computer science project that I have ever done was in CS 361, where me and my three
	team mates made a Battleship game using Java in Eclipse. That project was fun because I was working
	on a team. Also, we were learning a object oriented programming, which was very interesting.
	When it comes to computer science, I like working with high level programs using object oriented programming.
	I don't like C or assembly programming as much. I am exited for CS 290.
